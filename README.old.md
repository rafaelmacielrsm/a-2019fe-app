## Information about this project
### Q1: How is this project approached? 
**A -** First, there will be an overview of the task at hand, this very first step will be necessary to show possible weak points (skill and tech-wise) and the need to study new lib APIs and/or their DSL.
### Q2: What technologies will be used?

 - **BackEnd**
 -- ExpressJS
 -- PostgreSQL
 -- Waterline*
 -- JsonWebToken
 -- Jest
 
 - **FrontEnd**
 -- ReactJS
 -- AphroditeJS
 -- Jest
 -- lodash
 -- ReactRouter
 -- Redux, *et cetera*
 -- TypeScript*
   
### Q3 -  Challenging requirements:
**A -** Usually testing front-end code beyond the redux data flow isn't in my general workflow.

### Q4 - Things that would be done differently  in case the time to complete the task was longer:
**A -** I'd do some animations and tinker around with underscoreJS or Ramda. I'd also Expand my code-base with more meta-programmed component, and probably some refactoring.
